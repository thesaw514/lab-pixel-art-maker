# FEND Lab: 'Pixel Art Maker'
*Lesson 2.22 in the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.*

**Pixel Art Maker**

You create a one-page web application that lets users draw a pixel image on a customizable panel.

To begin, you'll be given starter code (including HTML and CSS) to build the application. You'll write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

Your users should be able to:

1. Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
2. Choose a color.
3. Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.

Your primary task is to implement the `makeGrid()` function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.
